Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy:
Founder
Lead Manager
Senior Manager
Manager
Employee

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2

SELECT c.company_code, 
       c.founder, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT e.lead_manager_code) AS distinct_lead_managers,
       COUNT(DISTINCT e.senior_manager_code) AS distinct_senior_managers,
       COUNT(DISTINCT e.manager_code) AS distinct_managers,
       COUNT(DISTINCT e.employee_code) AS distinct_employees
FROM Company c
JOIN Employee e
    ON c.company_code = e.company_code
GROUP BY c.company_code, c.founder
ORDER BY c.company_code;
