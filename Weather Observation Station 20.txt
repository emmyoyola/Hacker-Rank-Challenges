A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

WITH cte_lat AS 
(
SELECT LAT_N, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY LAT_N) rn, COUNT(*) OVER() tot
FROM STATION
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(LAT_N), 4)
FROM cte_lat
WHERE rn IN ((tot + 1)/2, (tot + 2)/2)
